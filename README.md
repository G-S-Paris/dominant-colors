# dominant-colors
## My first ever side project! 
I worked on this last summer - I black-box reverse engineered the DominantColors bot on twitter for the fun of it. 
Its tough finding the time to work on projects outside of work, but every time I do I get so much enjoyment out of it. 
I feel I also grow in new ways, and I grow in ways that help me at work too! - GSP 20201012
